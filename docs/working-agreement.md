# Working Agreements

_Last updated: 2025-10-21_

This document defines our team‚Äôs shared norms, inclusivity practices, and clarity guidelines for collaboration.  
All members agree to follow these throughout the project.

---

## üó®Ô∏è 1. Communication Norms

### Channels
All main communication and meeting coordination will happen on **Microsoft Teams**.  
Decisions and documentation are summarized in **GitHub Issues** or the **Wiki** so the record remains visible to everyone.

### Response Times
Team members should respond to Teams messages or GitHub comments **within 24 hours** on weekdays.  
If unavailable, post a short status message in Teams (e.g., ‚ÄúBusy until 6 PM today‚Äù).

### Meeting Etiquette
- Meetings start and end on time.  
- Cameras and microphones are encouraged (if comfortable).  
- Everyone gets equal speaking time.  
- The facilitator summarizes key points and next steps before the meeting ends.

### Pull Request (PR) Tone
All reviews should remain **respectful and helpful**.  
Use positive phrasing (e.g., ‚ÄúCould we try‚Ä¶‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúThis is wrong‚Äù).  
Each PR must be reviewed by **at least one teammate** before merging.

## üåà 2. Inclusivity Practices

### Roles
- **Facilitator:** Leads meetings on Teams and ensures all voices are heard.  
- **Scribe:** Records meeting notes and updates this file after discussions.  
- **Contributors:** Share ideas and feedback actively.

Roles rotate weekly to promote fairness and skill development.

### Inclusivity Drill Summary
During our inclusivity discussion, each member suggested one idea to improve team collaboration:

- Encourage everyone to speak once before anyone speaks twice. **(Owner: Alice)**  
- Write clear, simple English in Teams chat and GitHub Issues. **(Owner: Ben)**  
- Check in on teammates who are quiet or missing from meetings. **(Owner: Charlie)**

## ‚úçÔ∏è 3. Clarity & Collaboration

### Decision-Making
- Major decisions are posted in **GitHub Issues** and linked in Teams for visibility.  
- A decision is confirmed when **two or more members approve** via comment or emoji reaction.

### File & Branch Naming
- Use **kebab-case** for files (e.g., `task-manager.py`).  
- Branch names follow `feature/short-description`.  
- Commit messages start with a verb (e.g., `Add login form validation`).

### Review Process
1. Open a Pull Request.  
2. Add at least one reviewer.  
3. Discuss and address feedback.  
4. Merge only after approval.  
5. Close the related Issue when merged.

---

## üîÑ 4. Maintenance
- This document will be updated whenever norms or roles change.  
- The **Scribe** opens a PR titled:  
  `chore(docs): update working-agreements.md` whenever an update occurs.
